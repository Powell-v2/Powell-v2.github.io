title: How I Redesigned My Website
published: true
---

As a "frontender" who is paving his way towards fullstack, I tend to work a lot with CLI tools. They are an essential part of my workflow, and console has become a reliable companion over the past couple of years. One day, an odd idea sprang up in my mind - to redesign my personal website, which was a typical collection of webpages with a navbar, as a terminal window. Many people not familiar with programming dread even a glimpse of thought of having to interact with it, and that's understandable. We are all hardwired to fear the unknown. In reality, interacting with command line becomes a breeze once you get familiar with its mechanics - it only takes a little bit of practice.

Final prototype (with styling) was ready in two days. I had several variations of background in mind, and chose canvas over gradient or some abstract geometrical pattern since it was going to be more challenging - exactly what I needed to solidify recently acquired knowledge about drawing in the browser.

Flexbox was chosen for the layout due to its wide support. However, slowly but surely Grid is making its way and I definitely plan to implement it in the nearest future as a primary option, with Flexbox as a fallback for older browsers.

*"Responsive or not?"* ceased to be a question long time ago hence I made sure webpage looks great on smaller screens too. Poking into terminal on a phone might sound like a joke, although it's no reason to skip on responsive design despite its challenges. After all, **powell** is meant to be a simplified replica of real-world CLI tool.

From UX's standpoint, my website is far from ideals of user-friendly, but I hope it would appeal to brothers-and-sisters-in-arms. Made with joy and for the love of web development ðŸ§¡.
