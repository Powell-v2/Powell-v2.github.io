title: First Open Source Contribution
---

Yesterday my first PR got merged (woohoo!), which marks the beginning of my path in the open source world.

Its landscape is vast and diverse, and for a newcomer who is looking for an opportunity to make a contribution for the first time, the task of finding the right issue might seem daunting. I certainly felt a bit lost while navigating through the seemingly endless sea of projects available on GitHub. Luckily, at one point, I stumbled across [this wonderful guide][1] and a set of bite-sized [video lessons made by Kent C. Dodds][2]. The former could be seen as an encyclopedia, covering everything from code of conduct to project maintaining best practices and licensing, while the latter walks you through the complete process of making first-time contribution. I'm especially thankful to Kent since he demystified the whole thing for me =) Only a month ago I held a belief that open source software is all about code, but it turns out that the story doesn't end there - documentation, answering questions, issue triage, translations ... there is so much more to it.

I really like how everything unfolds so far. I took my learning to the next level while making a positive impact - isn't that a fantastic combination? And the journey has just begun.

**P.S.** Here is a word of encouragement for soon-to-become contributors: no matter the size of your contribution, it makes a difference. Let's improve the world we live in incrementally, one commit at a time.</p>
