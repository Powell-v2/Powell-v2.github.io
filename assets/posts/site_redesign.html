<p>As a "frontender" who is paving his way towards fullstack, I tend to work a lot
with CLI tools. They are an essential part of my workflow, and console has become
a reliable companion over the past couple of years. One day, an odd idea sprang up
in my mind - to redesign my personal website, which was a typical collection of
webpages with a navbar, as a terminal window. Many people not familiar with programming
dread even a glimpse of thought of having to interact with it, and that's understandable.
We are all hardwired to fear the unknown. In reality, interacting with command
line becomes a breeze once you get familiar with its mechanics - it only takes a
little bit of practice.</p>

<p>Final prototype (with styling) was ready in two days. I had several variations of background in mind,
and chose canvas over gradient or some abstract geometrical pattern since it was going
to be more challenging - exactly what I needed to solidify recently acquired knowledge
about drawing in the browser.</p>

<p>Flexbox was chosen for the layout due to its wide support. However, slowly but surely
Grid is making its way and I definitely plan to implement it in the nearest future
as a primary option, with Flexbox as a fallback for older browsers.</p>

<p><span class='italic'>"Responsive or not?"</span> ceased to be a question long time ago
hence I made sure webpage looks great on smaller screens too. Poking into terminal on
a phone might sound like a joke, although it's no reason to skip on responsive
design despite its challenges. After all, <span class='bold'>powell</span> is meant to
be a simplified replica of real-world CLI tool.</p>

<p>From UX's standpoint, my website is far from ideals of user-friendly, but I hope
it would appeal to brothers-and-sisters-in-arms. Made with joy and for the love of web development &lt;3.</p>

<!-- <p>Without further due, meet <span class='bold'>powell</span>,
command line interface representing ... you guessed it, me. You can interact with
it using options (also known as flags) - just pick one and put it after the command's name.
Each option outputs a piece of text into terminal window. For example, <span class='bold'>--contact</span>
will show you my contact info, and <span class='bold'>--skills</span> spits out
few paragraphs describing my professional skills. As it usually is, list of all
available actions is available in the help section.</p> -->
