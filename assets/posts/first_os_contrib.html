Yesterday my first PR got merged (woohoo!), which marks the beginning of my path in
the open source world.<br>

Its landscape is vast and diverse, and for a newcomer who
is looking for an opportunity to make a contribution for the first time, the
task of finding the right issue might seem daunting. I certainly felt a bit lost
while navigating through the seemingly endless sea of projects available on GitHub.
Luckily, at one point, I stumbled across <a href="https://opensource.guide/" target="_blank">this wonderful guide</a>
and a set of bite-sized <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github" target="_blank">video lessons made by Kent C. Dodds</a>.
The former could be seen as an encyclopedia, covering everything from code of
conduct to project maintaining best practices and licensing, while the latter
walks you through the complete process of making first-time contribution.
I'm especially thankful to Kent since he demystified the whole thing for me =)
Only a month ago I held a belief that open source software is all about code,
but it turns out that the story doesn't end there - documentation, answering
questions, issue triage, translations ... there is so much more to it.<br>

I really like how everything unfolds so far. I took my learning to the next level
while making a positive impact - isn't that a fantastic combination? And the journey
has just begun.<br>

<strong>P.S.</strong> Here is a word of encouragement for soon-to-become contributors:
no matter the size of your contribution, it makes a difference. Let's improve the
world we live in incrementally, one commit at a time.</p>
